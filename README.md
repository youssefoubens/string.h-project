# String Operations Project

This project implements various string and memory manipulation functions similar to those found in the C standard library's `string.h` and `memory.h` headers.

## Functions Implemented

- `strcat`: Concatenates two strings.
- `strchr`: Locates the first occurrence of a character in a string.
- `strcmp`: Compares two strings.
- `strcpy`: Copies a string.
- `strcspn`: Returns the length of the initial segment of the string that contains only characters not in another string.
- `strdup`: Duplicates a string.
- `strlen`: Computes the length of a string.
- `strncat`: Concatenates two strings up to a specified number of characters.
- `strncmp`: Compares two strings up to a specified number of characters.
- `strncpy`: Copies a string up to a specified number of characters.
- `strndup`: Duplicates a string up to a specified number of characters.
- `strpbrk`: Searches a string for any of a set of characters.
- `strrchr`: Locates the last occurrence of a character in a string.
- `strspn`: Returns the length of the initial segment of the string consisting of only characters from another string.
- `strstr`: Finds the first occurrence of one string within another string.
- `strtok`: Breaks a string into a sequence of tokens.
- `strxfrm`: Transforms a string into a form that can be compared lexicographically.

## Usage

To use these functions, include the `StringOperations.h` header file in your C++ program and call the desired functions with appropriate arguments.
